# Fruitcakes full CRUD Full stack app

- Use express to build a server
- Use mongoose to communicate with mongodb
- Full crud functionality on our fruits resource
- User authentication
- The ability to add comments to fruits
- Maybe gather data from a 3rd party API (time permitting)

This app will start as an API, that receives requests and sends JSON responses, but eventually we will add a views layer, that will render HTML in our browser.
